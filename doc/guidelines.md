Basic Rules & Guidelines
========================

Test-Driven Development
-----------------------

We use test-driven development. So, if you want to write code, write tests first.
Please make your tests work, before you commit your code.

To run all tests use:
    ./bin/run_tests

or execute one test using:

    node tests/test-example.js

Coding Style

Coding Style Enforcement
------------------------

To enforce our Coding Style, we use the tool
[JSHint](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/).
If you want to use it in vim, here is a
[plugin](https://github.com/vim-scripts/jshint.vim).
