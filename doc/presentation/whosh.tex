\begin{frame} {whosh - a new approach to osm data import}
    \begin{block}{What?}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item tool to import osm geo data into a postgres database
        \item push data into the database as fast as possible
        \item actions not while streaming into the db should be handled by the db afterwards
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Why?}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item all available tools need a lot of time for the import
        \item all available tools need a lot of ram
        \item most of the tools available do more than we need
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

\begin{frame} {whosh - a new approach to osm data import}
    \begin{block}{How?}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item we use osmium - a lib for parsing osm data in multiple formats
        \item library gives callbacks on node, way or relation
        \item independent COPY command for nodes, way and relations
        \item COPY allows to insert data fast (and unchecked) into tables
        \item functions in pg/SQL create geometry objects
        \item streaming and use of pg/SQL should solve ram and time issues
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

\begin{frame} {whosh - a new approach to osm data import}
    \begin{block}{Future?}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item currently text format for COPY
        \item binary format would be better
        \item speed and usability benchmarks
        \item world domination ... eh import
        \end{itemize}
